## Laravel Webhook Server Integration Guide with Spatie Webhook and Adobe Document Generation API

This readme file provides a comprehensive guide on integrating a Laravel Webhook Server with Spatie Webhook, Pipedream, and the Adobe Document Generation API for Storefront in Raemulan Lands Incorporated.

### What are Webhooks?

Webhooks are a way for one system to send real-time data to another system as soon as an event occurs. In the context of this integration, webhooks play a crucial role in allowing external services, such as Pipedream, to notify your Laravel application about specific events, triggering actions and processes.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin the integration process, ensure you have the following:

1. **Pipedream Account:** Sign up for a Pipedream account at [https://pipedream.com](https://pipedream.com).

2. **Adobe Document Generation API Credentials:** Obtain API credentials for the Adobe Document Generation API from the Adobe Developer Console.

3. **Spatie Webhook Package:** Ensure the Spatie Webhook package is installed in your Laravel project:

    ```bash
    composer require spatie/laravel-webhook-client
    ```

4. **Laravel Webhook Server:** Set up a Laravel Webhook Server in your project. You can use packages like [spatie/laravel-webhook-server](https://github.com/spatie/laravel-webhook-server) for this purpose.

### Integration Steps

Follow these steps to integrate Laravel Webhook Server with Spatie Webhook, Pipedream, and the Adobe Document Generation API:

1. **Configure Laravel Webhook Server:**

    - Install and configure the Laravel Webhook Server according to the package documentation.

2. **Configure Spatie Webhook:**

    - Publish the Spatie configuration file:

        ```bash
        php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Spatie\WebhookClient\WebhookClientServiceProvider" --tag=config
        ```

    - Open the `config/webhook-client.php` file and configure options like `webhook_model` and `process_webhook_job`.

3. **Create Pipedream Workflow:**

    - Log in to Pipedream and create a workflow.
    - Set up an event source to trigger the workflow, extracting and formatting data for Spatie Webhook.

4. **Configure Adobe Document Generation API:**

    - Obtain the API base URL and authentication credentials.
    - Define the necessary endpoints and parameters for document generation.

5. **Handle Spatie Webhook in Laravel:**

    - Create a controller or job to handle Spatie Webhook payload.
    - Parse the payload and extract relevant data.

6. **Generate Document Using Adobe API:**

    - Use the extracted data to make a request to the Adobe Document Generation API.
    - Handle the API response, save, or deliver the generated document as needed.

7. **Handle Laravel Webhook Server Events:**

    - Configure your Laravel Webhook Server to listen for Spatie Webhook events and trigger the appropriate actions.

8. **Testing:**

    - Test the entire integration by triggering the Pipedream workflow, ensuring the Spatie Webhook is processed, and the document is generated using the Adobe API.

### Test Cases

1. **Laravel Webhook Server Setup:**
    - [ ] Ensure the Laravel Webhook Server is installed and configured correctly.
    - [ ] Confirm that the server is running and can receive incoming webhooks.

2. **Spatie Webhook Configuration:**
    - [ ] Verify that the Spatie configuration file has been published (`config/webhook-client.php`).
    - [ ] Confirm that the `webhook_model` and `process_webhook_job` settings are configured correctly.

3. **Pipedream Workflow Integration:**
    - [ ] Create a sample workflow in Pipedream to trigger the Laravel Webhook Server.
    - [ ] Confirm that the workflow executes successfully and sends data to the Laravel Webhook Server.

4. **Adobe Document Generation API Setup:**
    - [ ] Confirm that API credentials from the Adobe Developer Console are available.
    - [ ] Test the API endpoints for document generation using a sample request.

5. **Handle Spatie Webhook Payload:**
    - [ ] Send a sample webhook payload to the Laravel Webhook Server.
    - [ ] Confirm that the payload is properly handled, and relevant data is extracted.

6. **Generate Document Using Adobe API:**
    - [ ] Use sample data to trigger the document generation process.
    - [ ] Confirm that the API response contains the expected document or confirmation.

7. **Handle Laravel Webhook Server Events:**
    - [ ] Trigger a Spatie webhook event and ensure the corresponding Laravel Webhook Server action is executed.

8. **End-to-End Integration Test:**
    - [ ] Trigger the Pipedream workflow.
    - [ ] Verify that Spatie Webhook is received, Laravel Webhook Server processes the event, and the document is generated using the Adobe API.
